## Tips

- Use **bold** for tools (Python, SQL, Streamlit, GitHub) if your resume uses bold for tech.
- If space is tight, use Format 1 and drop the second line of the link (keep only GitHub or only dashboard).
- If the job stresses SQL, keep "SQL scripts for funnel and KPIs" in the bullets.
- Replace `[Your Streamlit URL]` with your real URL (e.g. https://ecommerce-sales-funnel.streamlit.app) or remove that part and write "Link in LinkedIn."
